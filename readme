# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
# The code performs the following steps:
# Downloads the compressed file to the working directory
# Uncompresses the archives in the working directory
# Builds six data frames from the following files: subject_test.txt; y_test.txt; X_test.txt; subject_train.txt; y_train.txt and X_train.txt.
# Builds an additional data-frame with the features.txt file
# Assigns name of the variables for each data-frame. We use the names in features.txt and, additionally, “Subject” and “Activities” for subject and y data-frames respectively. We took the decision to relate these DF with these names based on the number of rows/columns.
# Builds a dataframe for both groups, train and test, where each observation is identified with an activity and a subject. in order to do so, we bind the columns. We took the decision to relate these DF with these names based on the number rows/columns.
# Removes the original data-frames
# Builds a unique data-frame where merging the test and train data-frames through the rbind command, adding the observation of one to the other´s. This is possible as both data-frames share the same variables
# Removes the original data-frames
# Creates a new dataset with a subset of variables (those that contain "Subject" or "Activities" or "mean()" or "std()") in order to extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
# Generates a new variable that adopts the following values, "walking", "walkingupstairs", "walkingdownstairs", "sitting", "standing", "laying", when the "Activities" variable is “1”, “2”, “3”, “4”, “5” or “6”, respectively. The "Activities" variable is later removed. This is done in order to give descriptive activity names to the activities in the data set. 
# In order to appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names, we perform the following changes:
# every word is in lower case
# eliminate "," "_" "-"
# when a "t" is at the beginning of a variable name, it is replaced by "time"
# when a "f" is at the beginning of a variable name, it is replaced by "freq"
# a typo ("bodybody") is corrected
# From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. tidydta
# Saves the dataframe into tidydta.txt file
